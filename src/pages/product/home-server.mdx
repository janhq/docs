# Customize and run AI across all of your devices

Self-host and access your AI from anywhere with Jan server suite.

<Callout type='warning'>
  Jan's server suite is actively under development and lacking documentation.
  You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/janhq/jan/tree/dev/server) and [here](https://github.com/janhq/jan/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml).

  It is free to use. Your feedback is appreciated üôè.

## Why Home Servers

We built [Jan Desktop](/desktop) for our personal use. We're now building Server Suite, for our team & community use.

Our goal is to help teams, like ours, move past cobbling together demo apps to use AI at work. We should be able to customize and collaborate with AIs that are usable on a daily basis.

**Check out [Server Suite](https://github.com/janhq/jan/tree/dev/server) if you need to:**

- Self-host Jan, with multi client sync
- Customize it with Personal Data Connectors
- Simple Authentication (username / pw)
- Scales across Consumer-grade Hardware, including GPUs
- Everyone has admin level visibility and can see all conversations
- Create assistants that has access to the same knowledge base
