## HTTPS Proxy

HTTPS Proxy encrypts data between your browser and the internet, making it hard for outsiders to intercept or read. It also helps you to maintain your privacy and security while being able to bypass regional restrictions on internet.

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
  - When configuring Jan using an HTTPS proxy, the speed of the downloading
  model may be affected due to the encryption and decryption process. It also
  depends on the networking of the cloud service provider. 
  
  - HTTPS Proxy does
  not affect the remote model usage.
</Callout>

### Setting Up Your Own HTTPS Proxy Server

This guide provides a simple overview of setting up an HTTPS proxy server using **Squid**, a widely used open-source proxy software.

<Callout type="info">
  Other software options are also available depending on your requirements.
</Callout>

#### Step 1: Choosing a Server

1. Firstly, you need to choose a server to host your proxy server.

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend using a well-known cloud provider service like:

  - Amazon AWS
  - Google Cloud
  - Microsoft Azure
  - Digital Ocean
</Callout>


2. Ensure that your server has a public IP address and is accessible from the internet.

#### Step 2: Installing Squid

Instal **Squid** using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install squid
```

#### Step 3: Configure Squid for HTTPS

To enable HTTPS, you will need to configure Squid with SSL support.

1. Squid requires an SSL certificate to be able to handle HTTPS traffic. You can generate a self-signed certificate or obtain one from a Certificate Authority (CA). For a self-signed certificate, you can use OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout squid-proxy.pem -out squid-proxy.pem
```

2. Edit the Squid configuration file `/etc/squid/squid.conf` to include the path to your SSL certificate and enable the HTTPS port:

```bash
http_port 3128 ssl-bump cert=/path/to/your/squid-proxy.pem
ssl_bump server-first all
ssl_bump bump all
```

3. To intercept HTTPS traffic, Squid uses a process called SSL Bumping. This process allows Squid to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS traffic. To enable SSL Bumping, ensure the `ssl_bump` directives are configured correctly in your `squid.conf` file.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Configure ACLs and Authentication

1. You can define rules to control who can access your proxy. This is done by editing the squid.conf file and defining ACLs:

```bash
acl allowed_ips src "/etc/squid/allowed_ips.txt"
http_access allow allowed_ips
```

2. If you want to add an authentication layer, Squid supports several authentication schemes. Basic authentication setup might look like this:

```bash
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwords
acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
http_access allow authenticated
```

#### Step 5: Restart and Test Your Proxy

1. After configuring, restart Squid to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart squid
```

2. To test, configure your browser or another client to use the proxy server with its IP address and port (default is 3128).
3. Check if you can access the internet through your proxy.

<Callout type="info">
  Tips for Secure Your Proxy:

  - **Firewall rules**: Ensure that only intended users or IP addresses can connect to your proxy server. This can be achieved by setting up appropriate firewall rules.
  - **Regular updates**: Keep your server and proxy software updated to ensure that you are protected against known vulnerabilities.
  - **Monitoring and logging**: Monitor your proxy server for unusual activity and enable logging to keep track of the traffic passing through your proxy.
</Callout>


### Setting Up Jan to Use Your HTTPS Proxy

Once you have your HTTPS proxy server set up, you can configure Jan to use it.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.
2. On the **HTTPS Proxy** click the slider to enable.
3. Input your domain in the blank field.

## Ignore SSL Certificate

To Allow self-signed or unverified certificates, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click the **gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è)** on the bottom left of your screen.
3. Under the **Settings screen**, click the **Advanced Settings**.
4. On the **Ignore SSL Certificates** click the slider to enable.

## Clear Logs

To clear all logs on your Jan app, follow the steps below:

<Callout type="warning">
  This feature clears all the data in your **Jan Data Folder**.
</Callout>

1. Navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click the **gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è)** on the bottom left of your screen.
3. Under the **Settings screen**, click the **Advanced Settings**.
4. On the **Clear Logs** click the the **Clear** button.

## Reset To Factory Default

To reset the Jan app to its original state, follow the steps below:

<Callout type="error">
  This irreversible action is only recommended if the application is corrupted.
</Callout>


1. Navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click the **gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è)** on the bottom left of your screen.
3. Under the **Settings screen**, click the **Advanced Settings**.
4. On the **Reset To Factory Default** click the the **Reset** button.
