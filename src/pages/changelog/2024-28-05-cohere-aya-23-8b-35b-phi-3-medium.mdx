Jan now supports `Cohere`'s new models `Aya 23 (8B)` & `Aya 23 (35B)` and `Microsoft`'s `Phi-3-Medium`. 

More GGUF models can run in Jan - we rebased to llama.cpp b2961.

Huge shoutouts to [ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) and contributors for llama.cpp, and [Bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) for GGUF models.
