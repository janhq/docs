Revamped Jan's UI to make it clearer and more user-friendly.

- Updated Assistant, Model, and Tools sections
- Categorized customization options for easier control
- New settings for models, APIs, and experimental features

## New Model: Codestral

Jan now supports Mistral's new model Codestral. Thanks [Bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) for the GGUF model. You can download the model from the hub.

## More GGUF models

More GGUF models can run in Jan - we rebased to llama.cpp b3012.Big thanks to [ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov)
