Jan has added compatibility with Meta’s open-source language model, `Llama3`, through the integration with `llamacpp` (thanks to [@ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov)). 

Additionally, `Command R+` is now supported. It is the first open-source model to surpass GPT-4 on the [LMSys leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard).
