With this release, more GGUF models should work now! We rebased to llamacpp b2865!

## New remote models: Anthropic & Cohere APIs

Jan now supports `Anthropic API` models `Command R` and `Command R+`, along with `Cohere`’s `Claude 3 Opus`, `Claude 3 Sonnet`, and `Claude 3 Haiku`.

## New integrations: Martian and OpenRouter

Jan supports `Martian`, a dynamic LLM router that routes between multiple models and allows users to reduce costs by 20% to 97%. Jan also supports `OpenRouter`, helping users select the best model for each query.
