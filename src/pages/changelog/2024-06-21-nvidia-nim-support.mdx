## NVIDIA NIM

We've integrated NVIDIA NIM support.

## Qwen 2 7B

You can now access Qwen 2 7B directly in the Jan Hub.

We've updated to llama.cpp b3088 for better performance - thanks to [GG](https://github.com/ggerganov) 

## Fixes

- Fixed Anthropic API error
- Reduced chat font weight (back to normal!)
- Restored the maximize button

For more details, see the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/janhq/jan/releases/tag/v0.5.1).
