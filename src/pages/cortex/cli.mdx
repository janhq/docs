# Overview

Cortex is a Docker-inspired CLI that maps to the OpenAI API, providing tools to manage and interact with models efficiently.

# Check CLI setup

## Basic CLI Command

To check if Cortex CLI is set up correctly, run:

```
cortex -h
```

This command displays the usage information and available commands for Cortex CLI.

## Usage

```
Usage: cortex [options] [command]

Cortex CLI

Options:
  -h, --help       display help for command

Commands:
  models           Subcommands for managing models

  init|setup       Init settings and download Cortex's dependencies
                   Example: cortex init
                   
  serve [options]  Provide API endpoint for Cortex backend
                   Example: cortex serve

  chat [options]   Start a chat with a model
                   Example: cortex chat --model <model_id>

  run [options]    EXPERIMENTAL: Shortcut to start a model and chat
                   Example: cortex run
```

## Managing Models

The `models` subcommand allows for managing models. To view the available options, run:

```
cortex models -h
```

## Usage

```
Usage: cortex models [options] [command]

Subcommands for managing models

Options:
  -h, --help     display help for command

Commands:
  pull|download  Download a model. Working with HuggingFace model id.
                 Example: cortex models pull <model_id>

  list           List all models locally.
                 Example: cortex models list
  
  get            Get a model by ID.
                 Example: cortex models get <model_id>

  start          Start a model by ID.
                 Example: cortex models start <model_id>

  stop           Stop a model by ID.
                 Example: cortex models stop <model_id>

  remove         Remove a model by ID locally.
                 Example: cortex models remove <model_id>
```
