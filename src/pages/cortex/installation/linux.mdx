Install NPM on your machine before proceeding with this step.

</Callout>

```sh
# Install globally on your system
npm i -g @janhq/cortex
```
<Callout type="info">
Cortex automatically detects your CPU and GPU, downloading the appropriate CPU instruction sets and required dependencies to optimize GPU performance.

</Callout>

### Step 2: Verify the Installation

1. After installation, you can verify that Cortex is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```
2. Cortex is ready to use!
