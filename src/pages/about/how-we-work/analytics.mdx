# Analytics

Adhering to Jan's privacy preserving philosophy, our analytics philosophy is to get "barely-enough-to-function'.

## What is tracked

1. By default, Github tracks downloads and device metadata for all public GitHub repositories. This helps us troubleshoot & ensure cross-platform support.
2. We use [Umami](https://umami.is/) to collect, analyze, and understand application data while maintaining visitor privacy and data ownership. We are using the Umami Cloud in Europe to ensure GDPR compliance. Please see [Umami Privacy Policy](https://umami.is/privacy) for more details.
3. We use Umami to track a single `app.opened` event without additional user metadata, in order to understand retention. In addition, we track `app.version` to understand app version usage.
4. Additionally, we plan to enable a `Settings` feature for users to turn off all tracking.
