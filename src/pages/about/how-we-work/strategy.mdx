# Strategy

We only have 2 planning parameters:

- 10 year vision
- 2 week sprint
- Quarterly OKRs

## Ideal Customer

Our ideal customer is an AI enthusiast or business who has experienced some limitations with current AI solutions and is keen to find open source alternatives.

## Problems

Our ideal customer would use Jan to solve one of these problems.

_Control_

- Control (e.g. preventing vendor lock-in)
- Stability (e.g. runs predictably every time)
- Local-use (e.g. for speed, or for airgapped environments)

_Privacy_

- Data protection (e.g. personal data or company data)
- Privacy (e.g. nsfw)

_Customisability_

- Tinkerability (e.g. ability to change model, experiment)
- Niche Models (e.g. fine-tuned, domain-specific models that outperform OpenAI)

## Solution

Jan is a seamless user experience that runs on your personal computer, that glues the different pieces of the open source AI ecosystem to provide an alternative to OpenAI's closed platform.

- We build a comprehensive, seamless platform that takes care of the technical chores across the stack required to run open source AI
- We run on top of a local folder of non-proprietary files, that anyone can tinker with (yes, even other apps!)
- We provide open formats for packaging and distributing AI to run reproducibly across devices
