# Knowledge Retrieval
This article lists the capabilities of the Jan platform and guides you through using RAG to chat with PDF documents.
<Callout type="warning">
To access this feature, please enable Experimental mode in the [Advanced Settings](/guides/advanced/#enable-the-experimental-mode).
</Callout>

## Enable the Knowledge Retrieval

To chat with PDFs using RAG in Jan, follow these steps:

1. Create a **new thread**.
2. Click the **Tools** tab.
<br/>

<br/>
3. Enable the **Retrieval**.

<br/>
4. Adjust the **Retrieval** settings as needed. These settings include the following:

| Feature               | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retrieval**         | - Utilizes information from uploaded files, automatically retrieving content relevant to your queries for enhanced interaction.<br></br>- Use this for complex inquiries where context from uploaded documents significantly enhances response quality.                                  |
| **Embedding Model**   | - Converts text into numerical representations for machine understanding.<br></br>- Choose a model based on your needs and available resources, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.              |
| **Vector Database**   | - Facilitates quick searches through stored numerical text representations to find relevant information efficiently.<br></br>- Optimize your vector database settings to ensure quick retrieval without sacrificing accuracy, particularly in applications with large data sets.                                           |
| **Top K**             | - Determines the number of top-ranked documents to retrieve, allowing control over search result relevance.<br></br>- Adjust this setting based on the precision needed. A lower value for more precise, focused searches and a higher value for broader, more comprehensive searches.                                                     |
| **Chunk Size**        | - Sets the maximum number of tokens per data chunk, which is crucial for managing processing load and maintaining performance.<br></br>- Increase the chunk size for processing large blocks of text efficiently, or decrease it when dealing with smaller, more manageable texts to optimize memory usage.                                           |
| **Chunk Overlap**     | - Specifies the overlap in tokens between adjacent chunks to ensure continuous context in split text segments.<br></br>- Adjust the overlap to ensure smooth transitions in text analysis, with higher overlap for complex texts where context is critical.                                                  |
| **Retrieval Template**| - Defines the query structure using variables like `{CONTEXT}` and `{QUESTION}` to tailor searches to specific needs.<br></br>- Customize templates to closely align with your data's structure and the queries' nature, ensuring that retrievals are as relevant as possible.                                               |
5. Select the model you want to use.
<Callout type="info">
To upload an image or GIF, ensure that you are using a multimodal model. If not, you are limited to uploading documents only.
