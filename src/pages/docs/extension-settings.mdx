# Extension Settings

The current Jan Desktop Client has some default extensions built on this framework to enhance the user experience. This guide will show you how to configure extension settings.
## Specific Extension Settings
Jan offers an Extensions settings menu for configuring extensions that have registered their settings within the application. Here, you can directly integrate Remote Inference Engines with Jan without inserting the URL and API Key directly in the `JSON` file. Additionally, you can turn the Logging extensions available on or off in Jan. To access the Extension settings, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** on the bottom left of your screen.

3. The registered extension settings can be customized under the **Extensions** section.

1. Navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click the **Gear Icon (⚙️)** on the bottom left of your screen.
