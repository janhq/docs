## Integrate Ollama with Jan

Ollama provides you with large language models that you can run locally. There are two methods to integrate Ollama with Jan:

1. Integrate Ollama server with Jan.
2. Migrate the downloaded model from Ollama to Jan.

To integrate Ollama with Jan, follow the steps below:

<Callout type="info">
  This tutorial will show how to integrate Ollama with Jan using the first method. We will use the [llama2](https://ollama.com/library/llama2) model as an example.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Step 1: Start the Ollama Server

1. Choose your model from the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/library).
2. Run your model with this command:

```bash
ollama run <model-name>
```

3. According to the [Ollama documentation on OpenAI compatibility](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md), you can connect to the Ollama server using the web address `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`. To do this, change the `openai.json` file in the `~/jan/engines` folder to add the Ollama server's full web address:

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  "full_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions"
}
```

### Step 2: Model Configuration

1. Navigate to the `~/jan/models` folder.
2. Create a folder named `(ollam-modelname)`, for example, `lmstudio-phi-2`.
3. Create a `model.json` file inside the folder, including the following configurations:

- Set the `id` property to the model name as the Ollama model name.
- Set the `format` property to `api`.
- Set the `engine` property to `openai`.
- Set the `state` property to `ready`.

```json ~/jan/models/llama2/model.json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "llama2",
      "url": "https://ollama.com/library/llama2"
    }
  ],
  "id": "llama2",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "Ollama - Llama2",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Llama 2 is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters.",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "Meta",
    "tags": ["General", "Big Context Length"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```
