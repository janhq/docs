  - When configuring Jan using an HTTPS proxy, the speed of the downloading model may be affected by the encryption and decryption process. It also depends on the cloud service provider's networking.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.
2. On the **HTTPS Proxy**, click the slider to enable.
