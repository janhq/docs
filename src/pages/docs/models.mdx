# Manage Models
This guide provides comprehensive instructions on adding, customizing, and deleting models within the Jan platform. 

## Add Models

There are various ways to add models to Jan.

Currently, Jan natively supports the following model formats: 
- GGUF (through a llama.cpp engine)
- TensorRT (through a TRT-LLM engine)

### Download from Jan Hub

You can choose from a list of popular, recommended models directly from Jan app's Model Hub. 
These models are preconfigured with optimal runtime parameters. This is the easiest way to get started. 

1. Open the Jan app and navigate to the Hub.
2. Select models, clicking on the `v` dropdown to see more information. Models with the `Recommended` label are likely to run faster on your computer.
3. After downloading a model, click **Use** to activate it. Ensure it's selected in the model dropdown for your thread.

### Import or Symlink Local Models

You can also point to existing model binary files on your local filesystem. 
This is the easiest and most space efficient way if you already use other local AI applications.

1. Navigate to the Hub.
2. Click on `Import Model` at the top.
3. Select the model or the folder containing multiple models.
4. Optionally, check the box to symlink the model files instead of copying them over the Jan Data Folder. This saves disk space.

Windows users should drag and drop the model file, as using **Click to Upload** might not show the model files in Folder Preview.
