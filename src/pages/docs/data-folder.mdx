# Jan Data Folder
Jan stores your data locally in your own filesystem in a universal file format (JSON). We build for privacy by default and do not collect or sell your data.

This guide helps you understand where and how this data is stored.

## Open the Data Folder

To open the Jan data folder from the app:
1. Click the System monitor button on your Jan app.
2. Click the App Log button.
3. This redirects you to the Jan data folder.

## Folder Structure
Jan app data folder should have the following folder structure:
<Callout type="info">
Jan is stored in the root `~/jan` by default.
</Callout>
```yaml
/engines
  /cortex.llamacpp
  /cortex.onnx
  /cortex.tensorrt-llm
/models
  /model_A
    model.yaml
  model_A.yaml
/telemetry
  sessions.json
/themes
  /dark-dimmed
  /joi-dark
  /joi-light
  /night-blue
cortex.db 
cortex.log
```
### `jan/` (The Root Directory)

This is the primary directory where all files related to Jan are stored. It typically resides in the user's home directory.

### `engines/`

The engines directory contains different engine implementations used for processing various machine learning models. Each engine is specialized for a different type of hardware or software optimization.

### `models/`

The `models` directory stores various machine learning models and their configurations. There are two types of YAML files, each serving a distinct purpose.

- **model_A**: This folder contains files for `model_A` pulled from the HF (Hugging Face) repository.
  - **model.yaml**: The original configuration file from the HF repository. It includes all files the author provided (e.g., README.md, model file) and is used to generate the configuration file in the main `models` directory.
- **model_A.yaml**: Located in the main `models` directory, this Cortex-created YAML file contains metadata and configurations tailored for Cortex models. It is essential for models where metadata cannot be directly extracted from the model file, such as `ONNX` and `TensorRT` models.

In summary, `model.yaml` inside the `model_A` folder is the original HF configuration, while `model_A.yaml` in the main `models` directory is the Cortex-specific configuration.

### `telemetry/`

The `telemetry` directory is used for storing session data and user interactions.

- **sessions.json**: This file logs the details of each user session, capturing information that can be used for analysis and improvement of user experience.

### `themes/`

The `themes` directory contains different visual themes for the application, allowing customization of the user interface.

### `cortex.db`

This database file stores all threads, messages, and assistant interactions, enabling stateless endpoints for the Jan x Cortex app system except for the `chat completions` and `embeddings` endpoints.

### `cortex.log`

This log file captures application logs for the Jan app, recording events, errors, and other relevant information for troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Delete Jan Data Folder

If you have uninstalled the Jan app, you may also want to delete the Jan data folder. You can automatically remove this folder during uninstallation by selecting **OK** when prompted.

If you missed this step and need to delete the folder manually, please follow these instructions:

1. Go to the root data folder in your Users directory.
2. Locate the Jan data folder.
3. Delete the folder manually.
