# Jan Data Folder

After installing Jan, a structured data folder is created on the local filesystem. This setup promotes an organized approach to data management, allowing for straightforward configuration, extension, and interaction with Jan's functionalities. Below is a guide to understanding how files, conversations, and settings are organized post-installation, enabling users to verify and navigate the installation effectively.

## Folder Structure
Jan app data folder should have the following folder structure:
```yaml
jan/                                
  assistants/                           
  engines/                              
  logs/                                 
  models/                               
  settings/                             
  threads/                              
  extensions/                           
```
### `jan/` (The Root Directory)

This is the primary directory where all files related to Jan are stored. It typically resides in the user's home directory.

### `assistants/`
Stores configuration files for various AI assistants. Each assistant within this directory can have different settings and capabilities.

### `engines/`
Contains configuration files for different inference engines.

### `logs/`
Logs from the application are stored here. This is useful for troubleshooting and monitoring the application's behavior over time.

### `models/`
Stores the AI models that the assistants use to process requests and generate responses.

### `settings/`
General settings for the application are stored here, separate from individual assistant or engine configurations.

### `threads/`
Conversation history is kept in this directory. Each session or thread is stored in a way that makes it easy to review past interactions.

### `extensions/`
Extensions enhance Jan's functionality by adding new capabilities or integrating external services.

## Detailed File Layout
Each of the primary folder structures should have the following detailed structure:
```yaml
/assistants
  /jan                                  
    assistant.json                      
  /shakespeare                          
    assistant.json
/engines                
  engine_A.json                         
/extensions
  extensions.json                       
  /@janhq               
    /extension_A
     package.json                       
/logs
  /app.txt
/models
  /model_A
    model.json                          
/settings
  settings.json                         
  /@janhq               
    /extension_A_Settings
     settings.json 
/threads
  /jan_thread_A
   messages.jsonl                       
   thread.json                          
  messages.jsonl                        
```

### Assistants
- **Default Assistant**: Located in `/assistants/jan/`, it includes an `assistant.json` configuring the default settings and capabilities.
- **Custom Assistant Example**: The `/assistants/shakespeare/` shows a custom setup, also with its own `assistant.json`.

### Engines
- **Engine Configurations**: Files like `groq.json`, `nitro.json`, `openai.json`, and `triton_trtllm.json` in the `/engines/` folder configure how Jan interacts with various AI engines.

### Extensions
- **Extension Configuration**: The `extensions.json` in the `/extensions/` directory provides settings for all installed extensions.
- **Specific Extensions**: Subdirectories like `/@janhq/assistant-extension/` contain `package.json` files which import necessary modules for each extension.

### Logs
- **Application Logs**: The file `/logs/app.txt` captures general application activity.

### Models
- **Model Configurations**: Each model directory, such as `/models/modelA/`, contains a `model.json` with settings specific to that model.

### Settings
- **General Settings**: The `settings.json` in the `/settings/` directory holds application-wide settings.
- **Extension-specific Settings**: Additional settings for extensions are stored in respective subdirectories under `/settings/@janhq/`.

### Threads
- **Conversation History**: Each thread is logged in its subdirectory, such as `/threads/jan_unixstamp/`, with files like `messages.jsonl` and `thread.json` detailing the conversation flow and settings.
