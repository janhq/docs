7. You might use the wrong port when you [check the app logs](#how-to-get-error-logs) and encounter the Bind address failed at 127.0.0.1:3928 error. To check the port status, try using the `netstat` command, like the following:

<Tabs items={['Mac', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
    <Tabs.Tab >
        ```bash
        netstat -an | grep 3928
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab >
        ```bash
        netstat -ano | find "3928" 
        tasklist /fi "PID eq 3928"
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab >
        ```bash
        netstat -anpe | grep "3928" 
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
