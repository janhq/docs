- Hardware Requirements

### System Requirements

Make sure your operating system meets the specific requirements for Jan development:

- [Windows](../../install/windows/#system-requirements)
- [MacOS](../../install/mac/#system-requirements)
- [Linux](../../install/linux/#system-requirements)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 20.0.0 or higher)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 1.22.0 or higher)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (version 3.81 or higher)

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janhq/jan
cd jan
git checkout -b DESIRED_BRANCH
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Run Development and Use Jan Desktop**

```bash
make dev
```

This command starts the development server and opens the Jan Desktop app.

## For Production Build

```bash
# Do steps 1 and 2 in the previous section
# Build the app
make build
```

This will build the app MacOS (M1/M2/M3) for production (with code signing already done) and place the result in `/electron/dist` folder.
