# Architecture

## Overview

- Jan has a modular architecture and is largely built on top of its own modules.
- Jan uses a local [file-based approach](/developer/file-based) for data persistence.
- Jan provides an Electron-based [Desktop UI](https://github.com/janhq/jan).
- Jan provides an embeddable inference engine, written in C++, called [Nitro](https://nitro.jan.ai/docs/).

## Extensions

Jan has an Extensions API inspired by VSCode. In fact, most of Jan's core services are built as extensions.

Jan supports the following OpenAI compatible extensions:

| Jan Module | Description   | API Docs                                      |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Chat       | Inference     | [/chats](/api-reference/#tag/Chat-Completion) |
| Models     | Models        | [/models](/api-reference/#tag/Models)         |
| Assistants | Apps          | [/assistants](/api-reference/#tag/Assistants) |
| Threads    | Conversations | [/threads](/api-reference/#tag/Threads)       |
| Messages   | Messages      | [/messages](/api-reference/#tag/Messages)     |


## Modules

Modules are low level, system services. It is similar to OS kernel modules. Modules provide abstractions to basic, device level functionality like working with the filesystem, device system, databases, AI inference engines, etc.

Jan follows the [dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) such that `modules` expose the interfaces that `extensions` can then implement.
