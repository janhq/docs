# Privacy

Homebrew Computer Company is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled safely and responsibly. This policy outlines how we collect, store, and use your personal information when you use any of our products.

## Data Collection

Jan, Cortex, and all Homebrew Computer Company products do not collect personally identifying information. You can read about [our philosophy](/about#philosophy) here and audit our open-source codebases. 

### When you voluntarily provide data

We -do- collect personal information you voluntarily provide us, e.g., when you sign up for our newsletter, join our Discord, or contact us via email. 

### Jan 

Jan runs with privacy by default and is used 100% offline on your own computer. Your data (e.g., conversation history, usage logs) are stored locally and never leave your computer.

If you use a Remote AI API (e.g., OpenAI API, Groq API), your data will naturally travel to their servers. They will be subject to the privacy policy of the respective API provider.

Jan uses [Umami](https://umami.is/) for analytics, which is a privacy-focused, GDPR-compliant analytics tool that does not track personal information. We use this to get aggregate reports on OS and hardware types and prioritize our engineering roadmap. As per [Umami's Privacy Policy](https://umami.is/privacy), Umami uses the following data points to generate its reports:

- OS and device characteristics
- IP address

Jan does not get any of this data, and we do not track IP addresses or other identifying information. We are actively looking into more privacy-respecting ways to handle analytics, crash reports, and telemetry and would love to work with the community on this. 

### Cortex

Cortex is a library that runs large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer. Cortex does not collect any personal information.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal information with third parties except as required by law or as necessary to provide you with the services you have requested.

## Data Security

We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.

## Your Choices

You have the right to access, update, and delete your personal information at any time. If you subscribed to our newsletter, you may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe link included in our emails.
