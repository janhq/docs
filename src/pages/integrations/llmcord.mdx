## Integrate llmcord.py with Jan

[llmcord.py](https://github.com/jakobdylanc/discord-llm-chatbot) lets you and your friends chat with LLMs directly in your Discord server.

To integrate Jan with llmcord.py, follow the steps below:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the discord bot's [repository](https://github.com/jakobdylanc/discord-llm-chatbot) by using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakobdylanc/discord-llm-chatbot.git
```

### Step 2: Install the Required Libraries

After cloning the repository, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Callout type="info">
  A valid Python installation is required.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Set the Environment

1. Create a copy of `.env.example`.
2. Change the name to `.env`.
3. Set the environment with the following options:

| Setting                 | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`     | Create a new Discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications), obtain a token from the Bot tab, and enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT. |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`     | Found under the OAuth2 tab of the Discord bot you just made. |
| `LLM`                   | For Jan, set to `local/openai/(MODEL_NAME)`, where `(MODEL_NAME)` is your loaded model's name. |
| `CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`  | Adjust the bot's behavior as needed. |
| `LOCAL_SERVER_URL`      | URL of your local API server. For Jan, set it to `http://localhost:1337/v1`. |

For more configuration options, refer to llmcord.py's [README](https://github.com/jakobdylanc/discord-llm-chatbot/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions).

### Step 4: Run the Bot

Run the bot by using the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
python llmcord.py
```

The bot's invite URL will be printed in the console. Use it to add the bot to your server.
