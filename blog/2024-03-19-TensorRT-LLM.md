title: Benchmarking TensorRT-LLM vs. llama.cpp
description: Jan has added support for the TensorRT-LLM Inference Engine, as an alternative to llama.cpp. We provide a performance benchmark that shows the head-to-head comparison of the two Inference Engine and model formats, with TensorRT-LLM providing better performance but consumes significantly more VRAM and RAM.

Jan has added support [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) as an alternative to the default [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) inference engine. TensorRT-LLM allows Nvidia GPU owners to run blazing fast LLM inference as a hardware-optimized LLM inference engine that compiles models to [run extremely fast on Nvidia GPUs](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tensorrt-llm-windows-stable-diffusion-rtx/).

You can follow our [TensorRT-LLM Guide](/guides/providers/tensorrt-llm) to try it out today. We've also added a few TensorRT-LLM models to Jan's Model Hub for download:

- Mistral 7b
- TinyLlama-1.1b
- TinyJensen-1.1b üòÇ

:::tip

TensorRT-LLM support is available in [v0.4.9](https://github.com/janhq/jan/releases/tag/v0.4.9), but should be considered an experimental feature.

Please report bugs on [Github](https://github.com/janhq/jan) or on our Discord's [#tensorrt-llm](https://discord.com/channels/1107178041848909847/1201832734704795688) channel.

## Performance Benchmarks

We were really curious to see how TensorRT-LLM would perform vs. llama.cpp on consumer-grade GPUs. TensorRT-LLM has previously been shown by Nvidia to reach performance of up to [10,000 tokens/s](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/blogs/H100vsA100.html) on datacenter-grade GPUs. As most of Jan's users are proud card carrying members of the [GPU Poor](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-gemini-eats-the-world-gemini#the-gpu-poor), we wanted to see how the two inference engine performed on the same hardware.

:::info

An interesting aside: Jan actually started out in June 2023 building on [FastTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer), the precursor library to TensorRT-LLM. TensorRT-LLM was released in September 2023, making it a very young library. We're excited to see it's roadmap develop!

### Test Setup

We picked 3 hardware platforms to run the test on, based on Jan's userbase's self-reported common hardware platforms.

| NVIDIA GPU                | VRAM Used (GB) | CUDA Cores | Tensor Cores | Memory Bus Width (bit) | Memory Bandwidth (GB/s) |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| RTX 4090 Desktop (Ada)    | 24             | 16,384     | 512          | 384                    | ~1000                   |
| RTX 3090 Desktop (Ampere) | 24             | 10,496     | 328          | 384                    | 935.8                   |
| RTX 4060 Laptop (Ada)     | 8              | 3,072      | 96           | 128                    | 272                     |

:::warning[Low-spec Machines?]

We didn't bother including low-spec machines: TensorRT-LLM is meant for performance, and simply doesn't work on lower grade Nvidia GPUs, or computers without GPUs.

TensorRT-LLM provides blazing fast performance at the cost of [memory usage](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/memory.html). This means that the performance improvements only show up in higher-range GPUs with larger VRAMs.

We've found that [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) does an incredible job of democratizing inference to the [GPU Poor](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-gemini-eats-the-world-gemini#the-gpu-poor) with CPU-only or lower-range GPUs. Huge shout outs to the [llama.cpp maintainers](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/graphs/contributors) and the [ggml.ai](https://ggml.ai/) team.

:::

We chose the popular Mistral 7b model to run on both GGUF and TensorRT-LLM, picking comparable quantizations at `INT4`.

#### llama.cpp Setup

- llama.cpp commit [15499eb](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/15499eb94227401bdc8875da6eb85c15d37068f7)
- We used `Mistral-7b-q4_k_m` in `GGUF` with `ngl` at `100` (`ngl` is the abbreviation of `Number of GPU Layers` with the range from `0` as no GPU acceleration to `100` as full on GPU)

#### TensorRT-LLM Setup

- TensorRT-LLM version [0.7.1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/releases/tag/v0.7.1) and build on Windows
- For TensorRT-LLM, we used `Mistral-7b-int4 AWQ`
- We ran TensorRT-LLM with `free_gpu_memory_fraction` to test it with the lowest VRAM consumption (performance may be affected)
- Note: We picked AWQ for TensorRT-LLM as a handicap as AWQ supposedly sacrifices quality for performance

#### Experiment Setup

We ran the experiment using a standardized inference request in a sandboxed environment on the same machine:

- We ran tests 5 times for each inference engine, on a baremetal PC with no other applications open
- Each inference request was of `batch_size` 1 and `input_len` 2048, `output_len` 512 as a realistic test case
- CPU and Memory usage were obtained from.... Windows Task Manager üò±
- GPU usage was obtained from `nvidia-smi`

## Results

Our biggest takeaway: TensorRT-LLM is faster than llama.cpp on 4090s and 3090s with larger VRAMs. However, on smaller GPUs (e.g. Laptop 4060 GPUs),
